##Intro Readme

**Questions:**

>What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences.

>Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Reading and writing are two absolutely fundamental aspects of beginning to program.  Without these skills you would not<br/>
be able to comprehend the code you're looking at, nor copy it down; much less be able to type out your own code.

Attention to detail, involves not being sloppy as you type.  Was there supposed to be a colon there, is that command typed <br/>
correctly, are you trying to name different variables the same thing?  Who cares! It's not like computers are extremely<br/>
precise machines that require very specific input to function as expected; oh wait.  With programming, attention to <br/>
detail is paramount.  You have to be able to type things exactly how the computer expects and notice when you make mistakes.

And thirdly, being able to spot differences will enable you to trouble-shoot your code by comparing it with code that <br/>
works.  You need to be able to find potentially minute difference between two different things so that you can tell why<br/>
one thing works, and another thing does not.  Spotting differences also allows you to learn from another person's source <br/>
code.  How did they approach a problem differently than you?  Are they using tools that you don't know about, etc.

>Why do you need to not copy and paste?

When you just copy and paste things in you will miss all of the hand training, and hand-eye-brain coordination that <br/>
comes with typing everything out by hand.  When you type everything in by hand you will be better able to spot your own<br/>
mistakes, because you've practiced all the small-detail type syntax things.  You will also be better able to think and <br/>
type in code when there isn't a prompt showing you the exact answer.

>Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Zed gives a really good quote here - *"anything worth doing is difficult at first."*.  I love that, and it's totally true!<br/>
Practice and persistence is the key to learning anything difficult.  You have to power through the whole beginning phase <br/>
when everything is confusing and you suck at what you're doing.  But if you persevere and keep practicing, slowly these new<br/>
concepts will begin to make sense.  And then with enough practice -- Boom! -- programming will make sense, all the little<br/>
things you've been learning will become connected in your brain and you'll be able to problem-solve in code.
