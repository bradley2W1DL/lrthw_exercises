# Make your script print out just one line

# <- explain the almighty octothorpe hash-tag awesome
# the octothorpe denotes a comment, ie. text that ruby will just skip over and
# not try to run as code.  This is used to leave notes for yourself and other
# programmers to better understand what they/you're looking at.
