**Can you find a key combo in RubyMine to comment out a line of code?**

The key shortcut to comment out a line of code is "command slash" <br/>
You can comment out whole lines or groups of lines at a time with this.  Just highlight what you want to comment out<br/>
and use the shortcut (Cmd /)

If you want to comment out whole blocks of code with the `=begin...=end` format the shortcut is similar.<br/>
Just highlight everything that you want to comment out and use option-cmd-slash
___

*Example of the format used for large comment blocks*

```
=begin
This comment method lets you comment out large sections of code without excessive use<br/>
of the octothorpe

Just open the comment with the '=begin' and then you can close it again using '=end' just<br/>
like is shown here.
